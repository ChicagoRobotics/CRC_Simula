# CRC_Simula
Visual Studio Arduino Project for Simula®

This repository contains the Arduino source code for Simula® structured as a Visual Studio project. 
If you are not setup/familiar with using Visual Studio for Arduino projects, we recommend that you work
with the CRC_Simula_Library from within the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software).

## Project Setup

* Ensure you have the Arduino IDE extensions for Visual Studio installed. 
  * You can obtain this from [Visual Micro](http://www.visualmicro.com/) or the Visual Studio [Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/search?term=Arduino&target=VS&category=All%20categories&vsVersion=&sortBy=Relevance).
* Ensure that you have the Project 3rd party libraries installed as documented in: http://www.chicagorobotics.net/programming/ under the section for 3rd party libraries.
* Open the Project Solution File from within Visual Studio *Simula_BehaviorTree.sln* 
  * The main source file is: Simula_BehaviorTree.ino
  
  ## Tree Visualization
  The current state of the behavior tree can be found here: https://www.gliffy.com/go/publish/10755293
  
  This behavior tree approach drafts heavily from the work of "Prestokeys".  The fine work of prestokeys can be found here:
